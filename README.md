# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Project Overview
In the following project, we used Plotly to visualize the belly button flora of different participants in a study to find the optimal bacteria for meat substitutes. We used the D3 library to traverse a JSON file that contained all the data acquired from each participant. After accessing the JSON file with JavaScript's logic, we used various functions and D3's ability to manipulate the DOM to create a dashboard that includes a dropdown menu, demographic information, and different plots that highlight key attributes of each participant in the study. The dropdown menu allows the user to pick a participant. After selecting a participant, D3 event listening and handling calls on other functions to display interactive visualizations that pertain to each individual in the study. The visualizations show the top ten bacteria cultures found, the bacteria cultures with their relative sizes, and the washing frequency for each participant.
